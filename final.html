                question: "The CIA Triad (Each Component & How They Work Together)",
                answer: `The CIA Triad represents the three fundamental principles and objectives (also referred to as services on Slide 25/56) of information security. Every element of an information security program should be designed to achieve one or more of these principles. Together, they form the CIA Triad (Slide 25/56).<br><br>
                <strong>Confidentiality (Slides 26, 57):</strong><br>
                <em>Definition:</em> Measures aimed at safeguarding sensitive information against any unauthorized access or disclosure.<br>
                <em>Goal:</em> To maintain the privacy and confidentiality of confidential information, ensuring it remains accessible only to authorized individuals who require it for their job responsibilities.<br>
                <em>Mechanism Example (Implicit):</em> Encipherment/Encryption helps achieve confidentiality by hiding data (Slide 70).<br><br>
                <strong>Integrity (Slides 27, 58):</strong><br>
                <em>Definition:</em> Focuses on preventing any unauthorized modifications, deletions, or additions to the data.<br>
                <em>Goal:</em> To ensure that data is accurate and trustworthy, and that it has not been tampered with or altered in any way without proper authorization. Upholding integrity maintains the quality and reliability of data.<br>
                <em>Mechanism Example:</em> Hash functions (Slide 184, 188) and MACs (Slide 191) are used to verify data integrity. Digital signatures also ensure integrity (Slide 195).<br><br>
                <strong>Availability (Slides 28, 59):</strong><br>
                <em>Definition:</em> Involves ensuring that data is accessible to its users at all times, whenever they require it.<br>
                <em>Goal:</em> Concerned with the functionality of support systems (hardware, software, network infrastructure), ensuring they remain operational and responsive to user needs, allowing users to access necessary data for informed decisions.<br><br>
                <strong>How They Work Together:</strong> The CIA Triad components are the core pillars of information security. Security measures (like encryption, access controls, firewalls, hashing) are implemented to protect one or more of these principles simultaneously. For example, encryption primarily ensures confidentiality but can be used in modes that also help ensure integrity. Secure systems aim to balance these three goals according to the specific needs and risks involved. The overall security posture depends on effectively addressing all three aspects.`
            },
            {
                question: "The difference between CIA triads and Security threats",
                answer: `<strong>CIA Triad (Slides 25-28, 56-59):</strong> Represents the fundamental goals, principles, or desired properties of information security. It defines what needs to be protected: the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of information and systems. It's the objective or the state to be maintained.<br><br>
                <strong>Security Threats (Slides 24, 60):</strong> Are defined as any type of malicious activity or attack that could potentially cause harm or damage to an organization, its data, or its personnel. Threats are the potential dangers or sources of harm that aim to violate one or more principles of the CIA Triad. They can be physical (like theft, vandalism) or digital (like malware, ransomware, attacks). Security Attacks (Active/Passive) are specific actions that realize these threats (Slide 29).<br><br>
                <strong>In essence:</strong> The CIA Triad is the objective (what to protect), while Security Threats are the dangers that challenge or try to undermine that objective.`

                <ul>
                    <li>The primary goal of encryption (or encipherment) is to ensure <strong>Confidentiality</strong> (Slides 26, 57, 70).</li>
                    <li>It involves converting plaintext (original message) into ciphertext (coded message) using a specified key and algorithm (Slide 87).</li>
                    <li>This transformation makes the information unreadable to unauthorized parties or opponents, especially when data is transmitted over insecure channels (like the internet) or stored (Slides 70, 77).</li>
                    <li>It achieves this by hiding and covering the data (Slide 70).</li>

Parties must securely share this key (Slide 160).</td><td>Uses a pair of mathematically related keys: one public key (shared openly) and one private key (kept secret) (Slide 93, 143, 94).</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Encryption/Decryption</td><td>Sender & receiver use the same key (Slide 92).</td><td>Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key, and vice versa (Slide 143).</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Speed</td><td>Very fast encryption process (Slide 94, 154, 159).</td><td>Slower encryption process (Slide 94, 154, 159).</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Efficiency/Use Case</td><td>Best for encrypting large amounts of data efficiently (e.g., files, databases, VPNs) (Slide 94, 160).</td><td>Best for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and authentication (e.g., SSL/TLS, PGP, Bitcoin wallets). Often used for small amounts of data (Slide 94, 160).</td></tr>

                question: "Secure Hash algorithm sha (Description)",
                answer: `SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm, a family of cryptographic hash functions developed by NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology) (Slides 212, 213).<br><br>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> Designed to keep data secured by ensuring data integrity (Slide 184, 188). They produce a fixed-size "fingerprint" or "message digest" from a variable-size input message (Slides 182, 184, 213).<br><br>
                <strong>Functionality:</strong> They transform data using an algorithm involving bitwise operations, modular additions, and compression functions (Slide 212). They operate based on the Merkle-DamgÃ¥rd construction (Slides 207-209), processing the input message in fixed-size blocks iteratively.<br><br>
                <strong>One-Way Property:</strong> SHAs are designed as one-way functions, meaning it's computationally infeasible to find the original input message (preimage) given only the hash output (Slides 184, 200, 212).<br><br>
                <strong>Collision Resistance:</strong> They aim to be collision-resistant, meaning it's computationally infeasible to find two different input messages that produce the same hash output (Slides 184, 200).<br><br>
                <strong>Evolution (Slides 212, 213, 220):</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SHA-0:</strong> Obsolete due to vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>SHA-1:</strong> Developed 1993, produces a 160-bit hash. Widely used (TLS, SSL, PGP, etc.) but considered "broken" in 2017. Input size < 2^64 bits.</li>
                    <li><strong>SHA-2:</strong> Released 2002, includes SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 (producing 256, 384, 512-bit hashes respectively). Uses larger block/word sizes and more steps than SHA-1 for increased security (Slide 214).</li>
                    <li><strong>SHA-3:</strong> Released 2015. Internally different (based on Keccak algorithm and sponge construction), designed as an alternative to SHA-2 (Slide 220-221). Offers variable output lengths (e.g., SHAKE128, SHAKE256).</li>
                </ul><br>
                <strong>Structure Example (SHA-512, Slides 215-219):</strong> Processes 1024-bit blocks, uses 80 rounds of operations involving permutations, substitutions (S-boxes implicitly), modular addition, and XOR operations with round constants and derived message words to produce a 512-bit hash.`

                question: "Definition SHA",
                answer: `According to Slide 212, Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) are a family of cryptographic functions designed to keep data secured. They work by transforming data using a hash function (an algorithm with bitwise operations, modular additions, compression functions) to produce a fixed-size string (hash value or message digest) that looks nothing like the original. They are designed as one-way functions.`

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Security as Code (SaC) (Slide 245):</strong> Transforms security practices from manual processes into automated, scriptable components within the software development lifecycle. Involves using scripts or predefined code templates for enforcing policies, vulnerability assessments, automated remediation, and scanning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Defaults (Slide 247):</strong> Mandates that system configurations are inherently safe by default, understanding that many users don't change default settings. Examples include robust default password policies, MFA requirements, or disabling unnecessary services by default.</li>
                    <li><strong>Least Privilege (Slide 248):</strong> Users, processes, and system components should operate with the absolute minimum level of permissions necessary to perform their function. This reduces the potential damage if a component or user account is compromised.</li>
                    <li><strong>Separation of Duties (SoD) (Slide 249):</strong> Divides tasks and privileges among multiple users or roles to minimize the risk of malicious activity or errors. Ensures no single user has excessive access to misuse a system alone (e.g., developer writes code, separate person/system deploys).</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimize Attack Surface Area (ASA) (Slide 250):</strong> Reduces the number of points where an unauthorized user can interact with or attack a system. Achieved by limiting non-essential code, services, processes, open ports, and API endpoints, and removing unused features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete Mediation (Slide 251):</strong> Mandates that every access request to any system resource is thoroughly authenticated and authorized every time, without exception. Access rights must be verified for each attempt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Failing Securely (Slide 253):</strong> Dictates that a system should respond to errors or failures in a way that preserves the overall security. It should default to a secure state (e.g., deny access) rather than exposing vulnerabilities or sensitive information when something goes wrong. Error messages should be generic.</li>

                question: "Types of classic encryption: Caesar, Hill cipher etc ......",
                answer: `Based on Slides 100, 101, and 103-110, the classical (or traditional, character-oriented) encryption techniques mentioned fall into two main categories:<br><br>
                <strong>1. Substitution Techniques (Slide 101, 102):</strong> Letters of plaintext are replaced by other letters, numbers, or symbols.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Caesar Cipher (Slide 103):</strong> A simple shift cipher where each letter is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet (e.g., shift by 3, A becomes D). C = (p + k) mod 26.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monoalphabetic Ciphers (Slide 106):</strong> Each plaintext letter maps to a fixed, unique ciphertext letter (a 1:1 substitution across the entire alphabet). The key is the permutation of the alphabet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polyalphabetic Ciphers (Slide 107):</strong> Use multiple substitution alphabets. The same plaintext letter can map to different ciphertext letters depending on its position or context (e.g., using different shifts based on a keyword or position). Playfair is also a form of this.</li>
                    <li><strong>Playfair Cipher (Slide 108):</strong> Encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs) using a 5x5 matrix constructed with a keyword. Rules depend on the relative position of the letters in the matrix (same row, same column, or rectangle).</li>
                    <li><strong>Hill Cipher (Slide 109):</strong> A polygraphic cipher using linear algebra. Plaintext letters are grouped (e.g., pairs, triplets) and converted to numbers, then multiplied by a key matrix modulo 26.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <strong>2. Transposition Techniques (Slide 101, 110):</strong> The letters of the plaintext are rearranged (permutated) without changing the letters themselves.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rail Fence Cipher (Slide 110):</strong> Plaintext is written diagonally down and up across a number of "rails" (rows), and then read off row by row.</li>

                question: "Most common threats on web applications",
                answer: `According to Slide 258, the common threats listed are:<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SQL injection (Slides 259-260):</strong> A code injection technique where malicious SQL code is inserted into input fields (like username/ID). When the application processes this input, the malicious SQL runs on the database, potentially destroying it, stealing data, or bypassing authentication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) (Slides 261-262):</strong> An attacker injects malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. When a victim visits the compromised page, the script executes in their browser, allowing the attacker to steal session tokens, hijack user sessions, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Broken Authentication (Slides 263-264):</strong> Occurs when authentication and session management are implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or exploit other flaws to assume users' identities. This can happen through predictable credentials, insecure storage, session IDs in URLs, session fixation, sessions not expiring properly, or credentials sent unencrypted.</li>

                question: "Digital signature 3 status",
                answer: `The term "3 status" isn't explicitly used in the slides. However, based on the descriptions of Digital Signatures (Slides 74, 155, 195, 196), we can infer the key properties or functions they provide:<br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Authentication (Sender Identity):</strong> A digital signature, created using the sender's unique private key, confirms the identity of the sender. Only the holder of the private key could have created that specific signature for the message (Slide 195, 74). The receiver uses the sender's public key to verify this.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> By hashing the message and encrypting the hash (the signature), it ensures that the message content has not been altered since it was signed. The receiver re-hashes the message and compares it to the decrypted hash from the signature; if they match, the integrity is verified (Slide 195, 155).</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-repudiation (Implicit):</strong> Because the signature is created with the sender's private key (which only they should possess), they cannot later deny having signed the message. While the term "non-repudiation" is only used in the comparison table for asymmetric crypto generally (Slide 94, 154), the mechanism described strongly supports this property. Slide 74 notes the mechanism is used to "preserve data" and "sender's identity is to be notified."</li>
                </ol><br>
                <strong>Process Summary (Slides 195-196):</strong> Sender calculates hash of message -> Encrypts hash with Sender's Private Key (this is the signature) -> Sends Message + Signature -> Receiver gets Message + Signature -> Receiver Decrypts Signature with Sender's Public Key (gets original hash) -> Receiver calculates hash of received message -> Compares the two hashes. If they match, the signature is valid (providing Authentication and Integrity).`
